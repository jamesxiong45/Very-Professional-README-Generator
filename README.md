# Very-Professional-README-Generator

## Description

In this project, I was required to create an app that creates a professional README file by giving the user a few questions to answer.

## Usage

This app requires the use of VSCode! By typing node index.js into the terminal, you will be prompted to answer a series a questions that will be put into the newly created README file.
